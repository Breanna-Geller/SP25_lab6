# Lab 6: Interactive Markers (using Scan Matching?) 

## I. Learning Goals

- Learn to place and manipulate markers on the F1Tenth Simulator

## II. Overview

### Markers
Markers in ROS help us to visualize in rviz locations on the map. Markers can be used for a variety of purposes- but for our purposes, we will stick to projecting vehicle heading and visualization of other vehicle algos(wording...)

#### transform.cpp

Within the Scan Matching package provided, PLICP transformations (transform.cpp file) is provide on canvas. Students should replace the transform.cpp file from the node provided in the git version with that of the file provided. Students should document and report any changes made to any files other than correspond.cpp.

### Interactive Markers
Interactive Markers are similar to regular Markers, but they can be manipulated within rviz. Users can interact with them and freely change their positions and rotations dynamically. This will be extremely helpful going forwards, when students need to use Markers for a vehicle's heading in Pure Pursuit. 

### IV. Implementation
### V. Deliverables and Demonstrations

**Deliverable 1**: After you're finished, update the entire skeleton package directory with your `____________` package and directly commit and push to a repo shared with your TA. Your commited code should start and run in simulation smoothly.

**Shared Demonstration Requirements**:

**Simulator Demonstration**:





### VI. Grading Rubric

- Compilation: **10** Points
